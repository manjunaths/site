Hello! This is Manju, I'm currently an expert technologist @ [Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE)](https://www.hpe.com) working on Deep Learning/Artificial Intelligence. Earlier, I worked
on High-Performance Computing (HPC) and also scalable real-time visualization. My current interests are centered around pipeline optimization of large workloads, bayesian models such 
as Gaussian Processes (GP) and uncertainty quantification. I particularly like gpytorch for making GP models. To get in touch with me send me an e-mail at my gmail.com address manjunaths.
